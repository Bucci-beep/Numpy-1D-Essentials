# Numpy-1D-Essentials


Welcome to this beginner-friendly project where I explore the foundations of NumPy using 1D arrays only. The project includes a series of simple, hands-on exercises covering core NumPy topics such as slicing, dot product, broadcasting, universal functions, and more.

##  Project Overview

This project reinforces my understanding of NumPy through:
- Realistic, beginner-level exercises
- Hands-on application of essential NumPy operations
- Clean and well-commented code for clarity and reusability

---

##  Topics Covered

- Casting Python lists into NumPy arrays
- Understanding array shape, size, and dimensions
- Indexing and slicing 1D arrays
- Performing arithmetic operations on arrays
- Broadcasting and scalar operations
- Dot product of vectors
- Universal functions (`ufuncs`) and mathematical operations
- Using `linspace` for number generation
- Basic statistical analysis (mean, max, std, etc.)
- Boolean masking and mapping functions over arrays

---

##  Sample Exercises

Some examples of the tasks in this project:
- Reverse a 1D array using slicing
- Compute the dot product between two vectors manually and with `np.dot()`
- Apply `np.sqrt`, `np.log`, and `np.exp` to transform data
- Replace all values below a threshold using masking
- Count how many numbers in a random array are above 50
